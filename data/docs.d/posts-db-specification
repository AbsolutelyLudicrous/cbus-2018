The events database contains entries representing an individual event
Each event is named as a thirty-two character hexadecimal string, the UUID
	The string is randomly generated by a combination of hashing the event's creation timestamp* and taking the output of /dev/urandom
		* hashing the Unix timestamp, e.g. `hash(date +%s)`
Each event entry has the following attributes:
	A title, what will be displayed
	An owner, the USERNAME of the user which owns the event
		I debated with myself over whether I wanted events tied to user UUIDs or usernames, and settled on usernames because I figured that:
			0) user UUIDs should be used only by user-related functions
			1) Event coordinators may choose to transfer a username between user accounts, in which the following two cases happen:
				events tied to user UUIDs:
					old events from the event coordinators get taken to some obscure, perhaps personal, account
				events tied to usernames:
					when a different event coordinator takes over a username, old events stick with the account
	Contents, detailed information about the event
		Can contain multiple sub-entries, see the example JSON
	Tags, tags associated with the event

An example JSONified representation of a event entry might be as such:
{
	"title": "The Thirtieth Annual Meeting of the Oregon Firestarting Club"
	"owner": "firelover88"
	"contents": {
		"date": "2018-06-14"
		"location": "The YMCA down on Fifth Street"
		"description": "Do you love fire? Do you love making fire? Come on down, we'll show you around! We love making fire too! Join the fire, embrace the lovely sensation that comes with burning things!"
	}
	"tags": "fire,no cops,burn,flame,love,romance,fireplace,construction,destruction"
}
