<h2>What problem are we solving?:</h2>
I remember my mom talking about how she started a community-based non-profit organization and the lengths she had to go to in building a network to support its programming and outreach. It seemed that finding people with similar interests to come to her events was much easier said than done. Simply putting up a listing on the internet or sending a facebook blast would not reach people in a timely manner. Her experience is echoed by other community based not-for-profits and neighborhood organizations in the Columbus area that do not have enough funding to support a marketing campaign for their programs and outreach. This was the inspiration behind our app.
<br>
Our app is a message board for finding events you want to go to and posting events that others want to come to. The app will then notice, without ever storing anything on our servers, what types of events you seem to enjoy, and show you more of those. We also go one step further by adding more features that enhance the user's ability to remember events and communicate with event coordinators and fellow attendees as well as rate the credibility of another user. All communication will be secured so that a user's critical information is permanently known to them only.
