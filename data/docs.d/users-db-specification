The users database contains columns representing an individual user

Each user entry has the following attributes:
	A User UUID, an immutable unique string used to find the user unambiguously
		The UUUID is obtained by hashing the user's creation timestamp and taking input from /dev/urandom
	A username, used to log in
		This may be changed at any time, keep in mind that users are stored in our database as a UUID
	A real name, what is displayed
		May be changed at any time
	A password hash, the result of Python's hash() function applied to a user's plaintext password
		DO NOT! pass an unhashed password to the API and expect it to be hashed.
		The end-user's plaintext password should be hashed immediately in the app,
		and then sent to the API.

An example JSONified representation of a user entry might be as such:
{
	"UUUID": "-2547124822483364033-5695596234522377432"
	"username": "oldmeme"
	"realname": "John C. Burke, Attorney at law"
	"password": "-8481005321794197027"
}
