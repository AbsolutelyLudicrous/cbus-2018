The users database contains entries representing an individual user
Each user is named as a thirty-two character hexadecimal string, the UUID
	The string is randomly generated by a combination of hashing the user's creation timestamp* and taking the output of /dev/urandom
		* hashing the Unix timestamp, e.g. `hash(date +%s)`
Each user entry has the following attributes:
	A username, used to log in
		This may be changed at any time, keep in mind that users are stored in our database as a UUID
	A real name, what is displayed
		May be changed at any time
	A password hash, the result of Python's hash() function applied to a user's plaintext password
		DO NOT! pass an unhashed password to the API and expect it to be hashed.
		The end-user's plaintext password should be hashed immediately in the app,
		and then sent to the API.
	A list of preferences, what the user likes
		Stored in a single field as a comma-separated list.
		There are no spaces between preference entries.
		Preference entries are all lower-cased.
		Preference entries may contain spaces.
		e.g.: PREFS=food,egg,ham,bacon,car,truck,united states,best goddam country in the world,gun,america,politics,second amendment,alabama

An example JSONified representation of a user entry might be as such:
{
	"username": "oldmeme"
	"realname": "John C. Burke, Attorney at law"
	"password": "-8481005321794197027"
	"preferences": "law,criminals,the innocent,justice,swift justice,scamming people,widow,widower,widowix,money,ambulance,running,chasing"
}
